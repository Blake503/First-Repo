                <h2> A little bit About The River Otter</h2>
              
               <p> Most people think that otters are just cute and cuddly                animals but, I can assure you that they are much more than            that. Otters can grow up to 3 to 4 feet, and can get up to            30lbs in weight. They often live in dens built by other              river animals like beavers.

            <h3> A River Otters Eating Habits</h3>
              <p> River otters eat many things such as birds, crabs, fish, and even turtles.
              When most people think of otters they think of a cute animal, but when an otter is eating it is not pretty. They look almost like they have not eaten in weeks and most of the food they eat does not really end up in their mouth. When the otter eats it almost looks like the devil</p> </div>
